# Session Close Protocol

Before completing work, run this checklist:

1. `tbd close <id>` - Close any completed issues
2. `tbd sync` - Commit tbd changes to sync branch
3. `git add` + `git commit` - Commit code changes
4. `tbd sync` - Commit any new tbd changes
5. `git push` - Push to remote

Work is not done until issues are closed and everything is pushed.
