# Session Close Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Before saying “done” or “complete”, you MUST run this checklist:

```
[ ] 1. git add + git commit    (stage and commit code changes)
[ ] 2. git push                (push to remote)
[ ] 3. gh pr checks            (verify CI is passing)
[ ] 4. tbd close/update <id>   (update status for issues worked on)
[ ] 5. tbd sync                (sync tbd changes to git)
```

**NEVER skip this.** Work is not done until pushed, CI passes, and tbd is synced.

> **Tip**: Run `tbd close-protocol` anytime for a reminder of this checklist.
