# Writing Style Guidelines

All documents on a project should adhere to these principles.
Make edits as needed when editing documents to keep them in alignment.

## 1. Use Clear and Concise Language

- Eliminate unnecessary or extraneous words.
- Be casual, not overly stiff or formal.

## 2. Use Clear Structure

- Use headings, subheadings, lists, and other structural devices effectively.
- Keep structure logical and consistent.
- Make headings specific—cleave to the true contours of the subject matter.

## 3. Be Detailed and Specific

- Avoid vagueness or generalities.
- Use concrete examples and quality citations whenever possible.

## 4. Be Efficient

- Avoid obvious statements.
- Remove duplication where a document says the same thing in different places.

## 5. Be Respectful of the Reader’s Intelligence

- Write for a reader that is highly intelligent even if they are highly ignorant of the
  subject.
- Explain concepts (or cite good sources) clearly and concisely from first principles.
- Never dumb things down, be vague, or skip important technicalities or details.

## 6. Be Warm

- Be friendly in tone.
- Be gracious in acknowledging previous work, even if correcting it.
