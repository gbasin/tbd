# Welcome User After tbd Setup

Welcome the user with the message below.
This applies whether this is a new installation or the user is joining an existing
project.

## Instructions

First, run `tbd status` to check the current state.
Give a brief summary of the status (repository, sync status, integrations).

Then show the welcome message:

* * *

**Welcome! tbd is ready for this project.**

tbd helps you ship code with greater speed, quality, and discipline.
Here are examples of things you can say and what happens:

### Issues

| What You Can Say | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| "There's a bug where ..." | Creates and tracks a bug issue |
| "Let's work on current issues" | Shows ready issues to tackle |
| "Track this as a task" | Creates a task issue |

### Shortcuts and Workflows

| What You Can Say | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| "Let's plan a new feature" | Walks you through creating a planning spec |
| "Break the spec into issues" | Creates implementation issues from your spec |
| "Implement these issues" | Works through issues systematically |
| "Commit this code" | Reviews changes and commits properly |
| "Create a PR" | Creates a pull request with summary |
| "Review this for best practices" | Performs a code review with guidelines |

### Guidelines

| What You Can Say | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| "I'm building a TypeScript CLI" | Applies TypeScript CLI guidelines |
| "Help me set up better testing" | Applies testing guidelines |
| "What are the Python best practices?" | Applies Python guidelines |

**Tips:**

- Say **“Use beads to …”** and I will track everything with beads (issues).
  This works much better than the usual to-do lists for long lists of tasks.

- Say **“Is there a shortcut for ...?”** or **“Use the shortcut to …”** and I’ll look
  for the shortcut for that workflow.

Then ask if they’d like to explore any of tbd’s capabilities or get started on
something.
