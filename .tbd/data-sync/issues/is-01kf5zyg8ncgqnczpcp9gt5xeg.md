Implement installation mechanisms and agent integration for tbd. Key components:

1. **tbd prime command** - Output workflow context for agent integration
2. **tbd setup claude** - Install Claude Code hooks (JSON settings and shell hooks)
3. **tbd setup cursor** - Install Cursor editor integration
4. **tbd setup aider** - Install Aider integration
5. **Shell hook generation** - Generate bootstrapping scripts for cloud environments
6. **npm package verification** - Ensure npm package works for cloud auto-installation
