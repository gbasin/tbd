The `tbd status` command Integrations section should show specific file paths.

**Current behavior:**
```
Integrations:
  ✓ Claude Code hooks installed
  ✗ Cursor rules (run: tbd setup cursor)
  ✗ Codex AGENTS.md (run: tbd setup codex)
```

**Expected behavior:**
```
Integrations:
  ✓ Claude Code hooks (~/.claude/settings.json)
  ✗ Cursor rules - not found (.cursor/rules/tbd.mdc)
  ✗ Codex AGENTS.md - not found (./AGENTS.md)
```

**Implementation:**
- Update renderText() Integrations section to show file paths
- Use same path display format as doctor command
