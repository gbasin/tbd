The `tbd setup claude --check` command should show the specific file paths being checked.

**Current behavior:**
```
✓ Claude Code hooks installed
✓ Skill file installed
```

**Expected behavior:**
```
✓ Claude Code hooks installed (~/.claude/settings.json)
✓ Skill file installed (.claude/skills/tbd/SKILL.md)
```

Or when not installed:
```
⚠ Claude Code hooks not configured
    Expected: ~/.claude/settings.json
    Run: tbd setup claude
✗ Skill file not found
    Expected: .claude/skills/tbd/SKILL.md
    Run: tbd setup claude
```

**Implementation:**
- Update checkClaudeSetup() to include paths in output
- Use consistent format with doctor command (path in parentheses)
