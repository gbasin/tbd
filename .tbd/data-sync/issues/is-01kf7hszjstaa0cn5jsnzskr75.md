title: Audit all write file operations for atomic writes
type: is

Audit all file write operations to ensure we're using the 'atomically' library consistently.

We already use atomically in most places, but need a comprehensive audit:
- Search for fs.writeFile, fs.writeFileSync, fs/promises writeFile
- Ensure all are replaced with 'atomically' writeFile
- Check for any edge cases where atomic writes might not be appropriate

Files to check:
- All command handlers in src/cli/commands/
- File operations in src/file/
- Any scripts in scripts/

This ensures data integrity if the process is interrupted during writes.
