title: Implement tbd setup auto to detect and configure coding agents
type: is
updated_at: 2026-01-18T06:44:53.213Z
version: 6
---
Auto-detect available coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) and set them up automatically. Detection strategies:
- Claude Code: ~/.claude/ exists or CLAUDE_* env vars present
- Cursor: .cursor/ directory exists
- Codex: AGENTS.md exists or CODEX_* env vars present

Output should log what was set up and what was skipped.
