Update the design spec to remove all references to prefix auto-detection feature.

Files to modify:
- docs/project/specs/active/plan-2026-01-20-streamlined-init-setup-design.md
- docs/project/specs/active/valid-2026-01-20-streamlined-init-setup-design.md

Sections to update/remove:
- Prefix Auto-Detection Algorithm section
- References to auto-detecting prefix from git remote URL
- References to falling back to directory name
- Phase 1 completion checklist item about prefix detection
- Any examples showing auto-detected prefix behavior

Keep:
- Beads prefix extraction for migration (still valid use case)
- normalizePrefix and isValidPrefix descriptions (still used for validation)
