title: "Feature: Add tbd uninstall command to completely remove installation"

Add a 'tbd uninstall' command that completely removes the tbd installation from a repository. Should: (1) Delete .tbd/ directory with config and worktree, (2) Delete tbd-sync branch (local and optionally remote with --remote flag), (3) Delete .tbd-sync/ directory if it exists on main, (4) Warn and require confirmation unless --yes flag provided. **IMPORTANT: Help text and confirmation prompt must warn about FULL DATA LOSS - all issues will be permanently deleted.** Useful for: testing, switching away from tbd, and round-trip golden tests (import, operate, uninstall, repeat).
