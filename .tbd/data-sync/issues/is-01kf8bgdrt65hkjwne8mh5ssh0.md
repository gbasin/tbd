title: Remove unused index_enabled config and index.json references
type: is

The index.json query cache is not implemented. Remove:
- index_enabled from ConfigSchema in schemas.ts
- index_enabled from default config in file/config.ts  
- index_enabled display in cli/commands/config.ts
- index.json references from docs
- Update tests that reference index_enabled
Note: May need migration logic for existing config files that have index_enabled.
