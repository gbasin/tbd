Replace the custom atomicWriteFile implementation in storage.ts with the 'atomically' npm library. This aligns with our typescript-rules.md which already recommends using atomically. Benefits: TypeScript-native, zero dependencies, built-in error retry logic (EMFILE/ENFILE/EAGAIN/EBUSY/EACCESS/EPERM), concurrent write queueing for same path, symlink resolution. Changes needed: 1) Add atomically as dependency, 2) Replace custom function with re-export from atomically, 3) Keep same export name for backward compatibility.
