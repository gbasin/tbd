tbd-design.md says 'Dependencies stored on the blocker: B.dependencies = [{type: "blocks", target: A}]' which is confusing. Need to clarify: when 'tbd dep add A B' runs (A depends on B), the dependency is stored on B (the blocker) pointing to A (the blocked). The current wording is technically correct but reads backwards.
