Add a brief motivation section near the top:

## Why TBD?

- **Git-native**: No external services, no databases—just files in git
- **AI-agent friendly**: JSON output, non-interactive mode, simple commands
- **File-per-issue**: No merge conflicts from parallel creation (unlike JSONL)
- **No daemon**: Works in restricted environments (CI, cloud sandboxes)
- **Beads compatible**: Drop-in replacement, preserves issue IDs
