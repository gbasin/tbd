close_reason: "INCONSISTENCIES: 1) --from-beads called deprecated in tbd-docs but still works. 2) --beads-dir undocumented. 3) Design doc has --format and --branch that don't exist. 4) --merge and --validate not in design doc. Needs alignment."

Check tbd-docs.md, tbd-design.md, and CLI --help for the import command. Ensure all sources are consistent and accurate for:
- Command description and purpose
- All options (--from-beads, --beads-dir, --merge, --verbose, --validate)
- Deprecation note for --from-beads vs setup --auto
- Usage examples and migration workflow
