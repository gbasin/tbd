## Notes

Current setup tests run tryscript in sandboxed temp directories but use relative paths (../dist) that can behave differently depending on working directory. Should create proper fixture repos that simulate real user scenarios: new projects, existing projects with AGENTS.md, projects with .cursor/ directory, etc. This makes tests more reproducible and less dependent on test execution context.
