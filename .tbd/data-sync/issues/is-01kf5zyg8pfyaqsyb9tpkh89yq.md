## Summary

Add reference documentation explaining how to temporarily disable Beads when switching to TBD.

## Context

When users import their beads data to TBD (tbd import beads), they need a way to disable bd so that:
- Agents don't get confused by having both systems active
- The bd prime hook doesn't inject beads workflow context
- Git hooks don't run bd sync operations

## Recommended Commands

Document this two-command approach for temporary disable:

    bd setup claude --remove && bd hooks uninstall

This removes:
- Claude Code SessionStart/PreCompact hooks (from ~/.claude/settings.json)
- Git hooks from .git/hooks/ (pre-commit, post-merge, pre-push, etc.)

## What to Document

1. Temporary disable (reversible):
   - bd setup claude --remove - removes Claude hooks
   - bd hooks uninstall - removes git hooks
   - bd daemon stop - stops daemon if running

2. Re-enabling (if user wants to go back):
   - bd setup claude - reinstalls Claude hooks
   - bd hooks install - reinstalls git hooks

3. Permanent uninstall (later, optional):
   - Point to community uninstall script
   - Or manual: brew uninstall bd / npm uninstall -g @beads/bd

## Location

Add to reference docs, likely as part of migration/import documentation.
