title: Reconcile implementation vs spec merge strategy differences

The implementation uses simplified merge strategies vs the spec: 1) description/notes use 'lww' not 'lww_with_attic', 2) dependencies use 'union' not 'merge_by_id', 3) extensions use 'lww' not 'deep_merge_by_key'. Either update spec to match implementation or note the simplification.
