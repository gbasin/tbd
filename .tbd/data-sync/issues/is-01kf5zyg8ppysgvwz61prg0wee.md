Add a colored (dark blue) epilog at the bottom of all help/usage commands that displays: 'For more on tbd, see: https://github.com/jlevy/tbd'. Implementation: 1) Add createHelpEpilog() function in output.ts, 2) Update applyColoredHelpToAllCommands() to add the epilog to main program and all subcommands using addHelpText().
