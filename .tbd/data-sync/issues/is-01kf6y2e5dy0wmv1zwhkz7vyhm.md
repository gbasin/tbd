Currently, commands load configuration and mapping data in a repetitive pattern:

```ts
const mapping = await loadIdMapping(dataSyncDir);
const config = await readConfig(process.cwd());
```

While `loadDataContext()` in dataContext.ts exists, it should be expanded to:
1. Be the single source of truth for all command context data
2. Include the ctx (debug, json, color options) from the command
3. Be consistently used by ALL subcommands via the same mechanism
4. Be a shared library pattern that every subcommand uses identically

This will reduce code duplication and ensure consistent behavior across all commands.
