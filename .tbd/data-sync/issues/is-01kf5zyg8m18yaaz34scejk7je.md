Verify that --help flag works consistently on all subcommands (e.g., 'tbd list --help', 'tbd create --help', 'tbd sync --help'). Should not rely on a separate top-level 'help' command - standard CLI pattern is --help on each command. Commander.js should handle this automatically but verify all commands have proper help text.
