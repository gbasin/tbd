title: Add brief Sync Architecture section
type: is

Add brief section explaining how sync works for users who want to understand. Key points: dedicated tbd-sync branch (not main), never pollutes feature branches, content-hash conflict detection, automatic field-level merge (LWW for scalars, union for arrays), lost values preserved in attic.
