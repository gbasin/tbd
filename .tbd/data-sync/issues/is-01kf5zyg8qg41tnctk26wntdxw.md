Add marked + marked-terminal dependencies. Create renderMarkdown() utility in output.ts that: (1) Uses marked-terminal for colorized output when TTY, (2) Falls back to plain text when piped, (3) Respects --color option, (4) Caps width at 88 chars. This enables colorized Markdown in help text and docs commands.
