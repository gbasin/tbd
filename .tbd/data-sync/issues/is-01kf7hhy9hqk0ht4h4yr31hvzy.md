Make tbd doctor a comprehensive health check that includes:

1. Run tbd status output (setup/configuration section)
2. Run tbd stats output (issue statistics section)
3. Run additional health checks:
   - Git version
   - Config file validity
   - Issues directory
   - Dependency integrity (orphaned references)
   - Unique ID validation
   - Temp file cleanup
   - Issue validity (required fields, ID format, priority range)
   - Claude Code skill file
   - Cursor rules file
   - Codex AGENTS.md

4. Provide suggestions for any issues found

The output should be organized with clear section headers:
- STATUS
- STATISTICS  
- HEALTH CHECKS
- SUGGESTIONS (if any)
