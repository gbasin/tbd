Add the following counts to tbd stats (moved from tbd status):
- Ready count (issues with no blockers)
- In progress count
- Open count
- Blocked count

Keep existing breakdowns:
- By status (open, closed)
- By kind (bug, feature, task, epic, chore)
- By priority (0-4)

Add footer: 'Use tbd status for setup info, tbd doctor for health checks'
