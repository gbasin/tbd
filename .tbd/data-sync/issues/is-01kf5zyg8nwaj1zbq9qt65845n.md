title: Write docs/tbd-docs.md documentation file for bundling with CLI
type: is
updated_at: 2026-01-17T01:34:03.040Z
version: 1
---
Create docs/tbd-docs.md with comprehensive CLI documentation. This file will be copied to packages/tbd-cli/src/docs/ during build and bundled with the CLI for offline access via 'tbd docs'. Follow the pattern used in markform/tryscript where docs are maintained in docs/ directory and copied to code during build. Content should include: quick reference, all commands with examples, common workflows, ID system explanation, sync/import guides.
