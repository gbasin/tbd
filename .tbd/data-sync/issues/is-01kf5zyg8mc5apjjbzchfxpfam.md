The list command shows internal ULID-based IDs like 'bd-01kf2sp62c0dhqcwahs6ah5k92' instead of short public IDs. Current code just strips 'is-' prefix and adds 'bd-'. Should use ID mapping file for short IDs (e.g., 'bd-a7k2') and for beads imports, preserve original IDs from extensions.beads.original_id (e.g., 'tbd-401').
