close_reason: "INCONSISTENCIES in 'not initialized' suggestions: 1) tbd-docs says 'tbd setup --auto' (broken flag) and 'tbd init --prefix=X'. 2) tbd-design says 'tbd import --from-beads' (deprecated). 3) Actual CLI just shows 'tbd init'. All three disagree."

Check tbd-docs.md, tbd-design.md, and CLI --help for the status command. Ensure all sources are consistent and accurate for:
- Command description and purpose
- Output format (initialized vs uninitialized)
- Beads detection and migration suggestions
- JSON output format
