The local state file at .tbd/cache/state.json should be .tbd/cache/state.yml for consistency with other tbd config files (config.yml, meta.yml). Currently uses JSON with last_sync_at field. Change to YAML format. Files to update: packages/tbd/src/cli/commands/search.ts (STATE_FILE constant and read/write logic).
