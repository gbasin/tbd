title: Add golden tests for tbd sync git operations (commit verification)

Tests must verify that tbd sync actually commits files to the tbd-sync branch before pushing. Currently tests only check --status and error handling but NOT that files are committed to git. This bead must be completed BEFORE fixing tbd-1884.
