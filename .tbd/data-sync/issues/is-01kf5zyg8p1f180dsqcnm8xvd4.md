Create golden tests for tbd uninstall command.

**Test scenarios:**
1. tbd uninstall --confirm - Successfully removes .tbd/, tbd-sync branch, and worktree
2. tbd uninstall (no confirm) - Requires confirmation flag
3. tbd uninstall in uninitialized repo - Appropriate error message
4. Verify cleanup is complete: no .tbd/ directory, no tbd-sync branch, no orphan worktrees

Create cli-uninstall.tryscript.md following the golden testing guidelines.
