Implement the tbd prime command that outputs workflow context for AI agents.

**Specification (from design doc 6.4.3):**

```bash
tbd prime [options]

Options:
  --format <fmt>  Output format: markdown (default), json, brief
  --quiet         Suppress output if not in a tbd project (exit 0)
```

**Behavior:**
- Outputs workflow instructions and command reference (~1-2k tokens)
- Exits silently (code 0, no stderr) if not in a tbd project
- Adapts output based on environment (brief for MCP, full for CLI)

**Key design principle:**
Global hooks + project-aware logic. The hooks run on every session, but tbd prime only outputs context when .tbd/ exists.

**Reference files:**
- attic/beads/cmd/bd/prime.go (Beads implementation)
- docs/project/architecture/current/tbd-design-v3.md section 6.4.3
